# WebAutoSearch
WebAutoSearch is all about automatic search to a browser of your choice in just click of a button

For some reason, when you setup this up to your "program files" or "program files x86", 
some browsers may not work. One example is the geckodriver. It finds the "geckodriver.log" 
file to write and update, but it doesn't have permission to do so. If you really want to 
put it in that directory and run the whole app, just run as administration.
